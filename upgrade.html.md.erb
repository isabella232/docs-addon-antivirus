##<a id="upgrade-v1-v2"></a>Replace <%= vars.product_old %> v1.x with <%= vars.product_full %> v2.x

To uninstall <%= vars.product_old %> v1.x and install <%= vars.product_full %> v2.x in its place:

1. Retrieve the latest runtime config YML by running the following command:
  <pre>
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT runtime-config > PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is your environment
    * `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location where you want to save the runtime configuration.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
      $ bosh -e my-env runtime-config > /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. In the runtime config YML, remove all ClamAV properties under the `releases:` and `addons:` sections.

1. Update the runtime config.
  <pre>
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=clamav PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is your environment
    * `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location of the runtime configuration you are updating.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
      $ bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. Follow the instructions in
[Installing and Configuring <%= vars.product_full %>](./install.html)
to set up the <%= vars.product_full %> tile.

##<a id="upgrade-v20-v21"></a>About Upgrading <%= vars.product_full %> v2.0.x or later to v2.1.x or Later

Additional configurations might be required when upgrading from v2.0.x.
This is because of the following features introduced in <%= vars.product_short %> v2.1:

  * Support for existing mirrors with TLS
  * Ability to configure the **Mirror Port** used by <%= vars.product_short %>

###<a id="use-existing"></a>Using Existing Mirrors
In v2.0.x, <%= vars.product_short %> only supported using mutual TLS (mTLS) with <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>.
However, in v2.1.x and later, <%= vars.product_short %> permits the use of an existing mirror with TLS.

If you are currently using <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>
and want to use an existing mirror,
Pivotal recommends that you configure <%= vars.product_short %> to use the new mirror before
uninstalling <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>.

To do this:

1. Download the latest version of <%= vars.product_short %> that permits using an existing mirror with TLS
   from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-clamav-addon) to your local machine.
1. Upload the new `.pivotal` files to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
1. If required, upload any stemcells associated with the update.
1. Configure <%= vars.product_short %> to use an existing mirror with or without TLS.
    For instructions, see [Configure Anti-Virus](./install.html#configure)
1. Return to the **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** and click **Review Pending Changes**
1. Select all the products in your foundation and click **Apply Changes**.
1. Return to the ** <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** and uninstall <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> by deleting the tile.
1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Select **<%= vars.product_short_mirror %>** only.
1. Click **Apply Changes**

###<a id="configure-mirror"></a>Configuring the Mirror Port

In v2.0.x, the port used by <%= vars.product_short %> and
<%= vars.product_short_mirror %> was `80` and was not configurable.
Starting in v2.1.x and later, the default port used is `6501` and is now configurable.

**If you are using the <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> with <%= vars.product_short %>,**
do one of the following:

  * If you want to use the default port with <%= vars.product_short %> and
  <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>, then you do not need to make any changes after upgrading.

  * If you want to change the ports used by <%= vars.product_short %> and
  <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>, see [Upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> 2.0.x and Later](#upgrade-procedure) below.

**If you are using an existing mirror with <%= vars.product_short %>,**
do one of the following:

  * Configure your existing mirror to use the default `6501` port
  used by <%= vars.product_short %>.
  * Configure <%= vars.product_short %> to use the port used by your existing mirror.
    To do this, see [Upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> 2.0.x and Later](#upgrade-procedure) below.

##<a id="upgrade-procedure"></a>Upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> 2.0.x and Later

To upgrade <%= vars.product_full %>:

1. If you are upgrading to v2.2 or later, record the value in the <strong>CPU limit (percentage)</strong> field.
Upgrading to v2.2 or later restores this field to the default value of 50%.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
      All other configuration details are kept when upgrading.
    </p>
1. Download the latest version of <%= vars.product_short %>
   from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-clamav-addon) to your local machine.

1. If you do not have an existing mirror, download the latest version <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>
  from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-clamav-addon) to your local machine.

1. Upload the new `.pivotal` files to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

1. If required, upload any stemcells associated with the update.

1. If you are upgrading to v2.2 or later:
  1. Reset the value in the <strong>CPU limit (percentage)</strong> field. For instructions, see [Configure Anti-Virus](./install.html#configure).
  1. Set the **Timeout to connect to the database server (in seconds)** field. For instructions, see [Configure Anti-Virus](./install.html#configure).

1. (Optional) If you are currently using <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> and want to switch
  to an existing mirror instead, follow the procedure in
  [Changing the Port Used by <%= vars.product_short %> with an Existing Mirror](./changing-ports-existing.html).

1. Check that the port used by <%= vars.product_short %> and your mirror are the same.
If it is not, configure the **Mirror Port** used for <%= vars.product_short %>:
  * **If you are using the <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> tile,**
      follow the procedure in [Changing the Port Used by <%= vars.product_short %>
      and <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>](./changing-ports.html).
  * **If you are using an existing mirror and want to change the Mirror Port
      in <%= vars.product_short %>,** follow the procedure in
      [Changing the Port Used by <%= vars.product_short %> with an Existing Mirror](./changing-ports-existing.html).
  * **If you are using an existing mirror and want to change the
      port to use the <%= vars.product_short %> default of `6501`,** do that now.

1. If you have not already done so, apply your configuration changes:
  1. Return to the Installation Dashboard.
  2. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
  3. Ensure all products are selected and click **Apply Changes**.
