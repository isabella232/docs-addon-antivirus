This topic describes how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> (formerly known as ClamAV Add-on for PCF).

##<a id="assume"></a>Compatibility and Prerequisites

See the following topics to ensure you have the required component versions and prerequisites:

* [Product Snapshot](./index.html#snapshot)
* [Prerequisites](./install.html#prereqs)

##<a id="upgrade-v1-v2"></a>Replace <%= vars.product_full %> v1.x with v2.x

To uninstall <%= vars.product_full %> v1.x and install v2.x in its place:

1. Retrieve the latest runtime config YML by running the following command:
  <pre>
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT runtime-config > PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is your environment
    * `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location where you want to save the runtime configuration.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
      $ bosh -e my-env runtime-config > /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. In the runtime config YML, remove all ClamAV properties under the `releases:` and `addons:` sections.

1. Update the runtime config.
  <pre>
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=clamav PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is your environment
    * `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location of the runtime configuration you are updating.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
      $ bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. Follow the instructions in
[Installing and Configuring <%= vars.product_full %>](./install.html)
to set up the <%= vars.product_full %> tile.

##<a id="upgrade-v20-v21"></a>Upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> v2.0.x to v2.1.x or Later

To upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> v2.0.x to v2.1.x or later:

1. Download the latest version of the product(s)
   from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-clamav-addon) to your local machine.

1. Upload the new `.pivotal` files to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

1. If required, upload any stemcells associated with the update.

1. Follow the procedure in [Changing the Port Used by
<%= vars.product_short_mirror %> and <%= vars.product_short %>](./changing-ports.html).
