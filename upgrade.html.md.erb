    <pre class="terminal">
      $ bosh -e my-env runtime-config > /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. Update the runtime config.
  <pre>
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=clamav PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is your environment
    * `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location of the runtime configuration you are updating.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
      $ bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav /runtime/config/
