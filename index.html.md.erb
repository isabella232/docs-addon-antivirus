This topic is an overview of ClamAV Add-on for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="about-clamav"></a>About ClamAV Add-on for PCF

The ClamAV Add-on might be necessary for regulatory purposes if your compliance
auditor requires antivirus protection within your PCF environment.

For example, auditors sometimes expect that antivirus protection is present in
an environment that must comply with standards such as Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

ClamAV Add-on for PCF complies with the U.S. Department of Defense STIG rule SV-92701r1_rule,
version UBTU-16-030900, which belongs to group SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227.
